## Description

This is a full stack application that allows users to create accounts, sign in, create blog posts and upload them as well as comment on other peoples' posts! The motivation behind this app was to create a place for people to gather and share their ideas while also being in a secure environment that is password protected. I learned through this project that using routes and handlebars is not as straightforward as it may look, and it took some time to get it functioning the way I wanted it to but overall it was a great learning experience.
